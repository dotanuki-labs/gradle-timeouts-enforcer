## What

> Blog post to come, stay tunned

A simple Gradle plugin that enforces timeouts for all the tasks defined on your Gradle build.

## Using

**Step 01** : Add this property at your `<root-project>/gradle.properties` file

```
io.dotanuki.gradle.timeouts.tasks=10.minutes
```

For this property you probably want to assign a value based on your slowest build task(s).

**Step 02** : Apply this plugin into your build at your root level Gradle build.

- For `<root-project>/build.gradle`

```groovy
plugin {
    id 'io.labs.dotanuki.timeoutsenforcer' version '<plugin_version>'
}

```

- For `<root-project>/build.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
plugin {
    id("io.labs.dotanuki.timeoutsenforcer") version "<plugin_version>"
}

```

**Step 03** : Profit ðŸš€

Check [releases](https://github.com/dotanuki-labs/gradle-timeouts-enforcer/releases) for the latest plugin version. More instructions also available in the [plugin page](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.labs.dotanuki.timeoutsenforcer)

## Providing Timeouts

For the Gradle property this plugin reads, the specified value must follow the `amount.unit` convention, where 

(a) supported `unit` include :

- **second**, **seconds** (upper / lower / camel cases)
- **minute**, **minutes** (upper / lower / camel cases)
- **hour**, **hours** (upper / lower / camel cases)

(b) `amount` should be an **integer** value

Examples of valid specifications

- `1.hour`
- `10.SECONDS`
- `30.Minutes`

Examples of invalid specifications

- `1.5.hour`
- `30,5.minutes`

This plugin will parse and validate the provided specification and throw an error if it does not match expected conventions.

## Supported Gradle versions

This plugin supports only Gradle 5.x.y or newer.

## See it in action

To quick test this plugin in a real project, a `sample`is provided : 

```shell
$> cd sample
$> ./gradlew clean run
```

Sample will emulate a long task (**15 seconds** to complete `run`), but this task will fail after **10 seconds**, as defined in `sample/gradle.properties`.

```shell
âžœ  sample git:(master) âœ— ./gradlew clean run
Configuration on demand is an incubating feature.

> Task :run FAILED
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':run'.
> Timeout has been exceeded
